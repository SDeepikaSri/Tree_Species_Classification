#🌳 Tree Species Classification using CNN
This project is part of my AICTE Internship Week 2 submission and focuses on classifying tree species using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) implemented in TensorFlow and Keras. The model is trained on a dataset of labeled tree images to identify different species accurately.

##📁 Project Structure
tree_CNN.ipynb – Jupyter Notebook containing the full pipeline: data preprocessing, model building, training, evaluation, and prediction.

##🧠 Model Overview
Architecture: A sequential CNN model with convolutional, pooling, and dense layers.

Frameworks: TensorFlow & Keras

Loss Function: Categorical Crossentropy

Optimizer: Adam

Metrics: Accuracy

##📊 Dataset
Input: Images of different tree species.

Preprocessing:

Images resized to a uniform dimension.

Normalization applied for consistent pixel value ranges.

Data split into training, validation, and test sets.

(Note: The dataset folder structure should follow the format expected by ImageDataGenerator.flow_from_directory() with subdirectories for each class.)

##🚀 How to Run
Clone this repository or download the notebook.

Ensure the dataset is in the correct folder structure.

##Install dependencies:

bash
Copy
Edit
pip install tensorflow matplotlib
Open and run tree_CNN.ipynb in Jupyter or Colab.

##📈 Results
The model achieves good training and validation accuracy on the dataset.

Accuracy and loss curves are plotted to analyze performance.

##🧪 Future Work
Improve accuracy with data augmentation and regularization.

Use transfer learning with pre-trained models like VGG16 or ResNet.

Expand to more tree species with larger datasets.
